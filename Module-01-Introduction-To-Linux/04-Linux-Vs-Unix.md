# Linux vs UNIX

Linux and UNIX are similar but not the same operating systems.
UNIX is a family of proprietary operating systems, while Linux is open source.

## Key differences
- Linux is free and community-driven
- UNIX is usually commercial and vendor-specific
- Linux runs on a wider range of hardware

Linux was inspired by UNIX but evolved independently.
