# Linux Users

Linux is a multi-user operating system, meaning multiple users can work
on the same system at the same time.

## Types of users
- Root user – has full administrative privileges
- System users – used by services and processes
- Regular users – standard accounts for daily work

User permissions help maintain security and system stability.
