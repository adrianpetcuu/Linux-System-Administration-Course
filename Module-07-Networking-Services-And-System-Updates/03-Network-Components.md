## Network Components

A computer network is built from several key components that work together to enable communication between systems.

### Client
- Initiates requests for data or services
- Examples: web browser, SSH client, email client

### Server
- Responds to client requests
- Provides services such as web, file sharing, DNS, or databases

### IP Address
- Unique identifier for a device on a network
- IPv4 (e.g. `192.168.1.10`) or IPv6

### Subnet Mask
- Defines the network and host portion of an IP address
- Example: `255.255.255.0` or `/24`

### Gateway
- Routes traffic from local network to external networks (internet)
- Usually the router IP

### DNS (Domain Name System)
- Resolves domain names to IP addresses
- Example: `google.com → 8.8.8.8`

### Network Interface (NIC)
- Physical or virtual network card
- Examples: `eth0`, `enp0s3`, `wlan0`

### Firewall
- Controls allowed and blocked network traffic
- Example tools: `firewalld`, `iptables`

### Protocols
- Define communication rules
- Common protocols: TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP

### Summary
Network components work together to identify devices, route traffic, resolve names, and securely transfer data between clients and servers.
