# Linux Command Syntax

Linux commands follow a standard syntax
that defines how they are executed.

## Basic command format
command [options] [arguments]

## Components
- command – the program to run
- options – modify command behavior (usually start with `-`)
- arguments – targets such as files or directories

## Example
- `ls -l /etc` – list files in long format inside /etc

Understanding command syntax
helps use Linux commands correctly and efficiently.
