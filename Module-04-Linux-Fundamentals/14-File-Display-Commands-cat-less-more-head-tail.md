# File Display Commands

Linux provides commands
to view the contents of files
without modifying them.

## Common file display commands
- `cat` – display entire file content
- `less` – view file content page by page
- `more` – basic paginated file viewer
- `head` – display the first lines of a file
- `tail` – display the last lines of a file

## Examples
- `cat file.txt`
- `less file.txt`
- `head -n 10 file.txt`
- `tail -n 20 file.txt`

These commands are commonly used
to inspect files and log data
