# Adding Text to Files

Linux provides multiple ways
to add or modify text inside files.

## Using redirection
- `echo "text" > file.txt` – overwrite file content
- `echo "text" >> file.txt` – append text to a file

## Using text editors
- `vi file.txt` – edit file with Vim
- `nano file.txt` – edit file with Nano

## Using command output
- `command > file.txt` – save output to a file
- `command >> file.txt` – append output to a file

Adding text to files is a common task
in configuration and system administration.
