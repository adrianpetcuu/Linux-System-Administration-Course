# Difference Between vi and vim Editors

`vi` and `vim` are text editors used
to create and modify files in Linux,
but they differ in functionality.

## vi editor

- Available on all Unix/Linux systems
- Uses minimal system resources

## vim editor

- Supports syntax highlighting
- Provides undo history, search improvements, and plugins

## Key differences
- `vim` is more user-friendly and powerful
- `vi` is simpler and always available

For system administration and exams like RHCSA,
basic `vi` knowledge is mandatory,
while `vim` is preferred for daily work.
