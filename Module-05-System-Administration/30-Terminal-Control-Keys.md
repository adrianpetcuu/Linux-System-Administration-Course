# Terminal Control Keys

Linux terminals support control keys
that help manage running commands
and terminal behavior efficiently.

## Common control keys
- `Ctrl + C` – terminate the running command
- `Ctrl + Z` – suspend the current process
- `Ctrl + D` – end input or exit the terminal
- `Ctrl + L` – clear the terminal screen
- `Ctrl + S` – pause terminal output
- `Ctrl + Q` – resume paused output

## Job control keys
- `Ctrl + Z` – stop a process
- `fg` – bring process to foreground
- `bg` – resume process in background

## Notes
- Control keys do not kill the terminal
- They send signals to processes
- Essential for command-line troubleshooting

Terminal control keys
are fundamental for daily
Linux system administration.
