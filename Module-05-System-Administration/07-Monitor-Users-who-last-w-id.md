to monitor logged-in users
and view login activity.

## who command
- Displays currently logged-in users
- Shows terminal and login time
- Example: `who`

## w command
- Shows logged-in users and their activity
- Displays uptime and running processes
- Example: `w`

## last command
- Displays login history
- Reads data from `/var/log/wtmp`
- Example: `last`
- `last username` – show logins for a specific user

## id command
- Displays user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and groups
- Example: `id`
- `id username` – show info for a specific user

These commands are essential
for user monitoring and auditing
in Linux systems.
