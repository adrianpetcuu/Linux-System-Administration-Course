# Types of Shells

Linux provides different types of shells
that offer command execution,
scripting, and user interaction.

## Common Linux shells
- `bash` – Bourne Again Shell, most widely used
- `sh` – Bourne Shell, basic and lightweight
- `zsh` – Z Shell, advanced features and customization
- `csh` – C Shell, C-like syntax
- `tcsh` – Enhanced version of csh
- `ksh` – Korn Shell, scripting-oriented

## Shell categories
- Interactive shells – used directly by users
- Non-interactive shells – execute scripts
- Login shells – start at user login
- Non-login shells – started from another shell

Different shells provide
different features and syntax,
but all serve as interfaces
between users and the Linux system.
