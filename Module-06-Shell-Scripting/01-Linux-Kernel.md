- Controls memory usage
- Handles device drivers
- Manages system calls and hardware interaction

## Kernel components
- Process management
- Memory management
- Device drivers
- File system support

## Kernel space vs user space
- Kernel space runs with full privileges
- User space runs applications with limited access
- Applications communicate with the kernel via system calls

## Kernel version
