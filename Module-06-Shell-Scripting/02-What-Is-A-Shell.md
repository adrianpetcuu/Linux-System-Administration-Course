# What Is a Shell

A shell is a command-line interface
that allows users to interact
with the Linux operating system.

## Role of the shell
- Interprets user commands
- Executes programs and scripts
- Manages environment variables
- Provides job control and scripting features

## Common Linux shells
- `bash` – Bourne Again Shell (default)
- `sh` – Bourne Shell
- `zsh` – Z Shell
- `csh` – C Shell

## Shell types
- Interactive shell – used by users
- Non-interactive shell – runs scripts

The shell acts as a bridge
between the user and
the Linux kernel.
