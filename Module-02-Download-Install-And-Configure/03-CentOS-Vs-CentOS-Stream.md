# CentOS vs CentOS Stream

CentOS and CentOS Stream are related but serve different purposes.
CentOS Linux was a stable, downstream rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Key differences
- CentOS Linux: stable, production-focused, now discontinued
- CentOS Stream: rolling-release, upstream of RHEL
- CentOS Stream receives updates earlier than RHEL

CentOS Stream is mainly used for development and testing.
