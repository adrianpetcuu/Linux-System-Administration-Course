# Take a Snapshot of a Virtual Machine

A snapshot captures the current state of a virtual machine,
including disk, memory, and system configuration.

## Why snapshots are useful
- Restore the VM to a previous state
- Test changes safely
- Recover quickly from mistakes

Snapshots are commonly used during learning and system administration tasks.
