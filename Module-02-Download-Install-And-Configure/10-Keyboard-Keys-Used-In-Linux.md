# Keyboard Keys Used in Linux

Linux relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts, especially when working
in the command-line interface (CLI).

## Common keyboard shortcuts
- Ctrl + C – terminate a running process
- Ctrl + Z – suspend a running process
- Ctrl + D – logout or end input (EOF)
- Ctrl + L – clear the terminal screen
- Ctrl + A – move cursor to beginning of the line
- Ctrl + E – move cursor to end of the line
- Ctrl + U – delete text from cursor to start of line
- Ctrl + K – delete text from cursor to end of line
- Tab – auto-complete commands, files, and directories
- Up / Down Arrow – navigate command history

These shortcuts significantly improve productivity in Linux environments.
