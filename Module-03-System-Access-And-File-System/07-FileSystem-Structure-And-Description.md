# File System Structure and Description

Linux uses a unified directory structure
where everything starts from the root directory `/`.

## Important directories
- `/` – root of the file system
- `/bin` – essential user commands
- `/sbin` – system administration commands
- `/etc` – configuration files
- `/home` – home directories for users
- `/root` – home directory of the root user
- `/var` – logs and variable data
- `/tmp` – temporary files
- `/usr` – user applications and libraries

Each directory has a specific purpose,
which helps keep the system organized and manageable.
