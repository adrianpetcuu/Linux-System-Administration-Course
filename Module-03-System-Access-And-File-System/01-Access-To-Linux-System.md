# Access To Linux System

Accessing a Linux system can be done locally or remotely
depending on the use case and environment.

## Common access methods
- Local console login (physical or virtual machine)
- Virtual terminal (TTY) access
- SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access
- Graphical login (GUI), if installed

For system administrators, SSH is the most commonly used
and preferred method for secure remote access.
