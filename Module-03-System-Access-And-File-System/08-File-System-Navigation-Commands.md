# File System Navigation Commands

Linux provides several commands to move through
and inspect the file system.

## Common navigation commands
- `pwd` – display the current directory
- `ls` – list files and directories
- `cd` – change the current directory
- `tree` – display directory structure as a tree

## Useful options
- `ls -l` – long listing format
- `ls -a` – show hidden files
- `cd ..` – move to the parent directory
- `cd ~` – move to the home directory

These commands are essential
for daily Linux system administration.
