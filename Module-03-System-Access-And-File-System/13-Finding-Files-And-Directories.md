# Finding Files and Directories

Linux provides commands to search for files
and directories based on name, location, or attributes.

## Common search commands
- `find /path -name filename` – search by name
- `find /path -type d` – find directories only
- `find /path -type f` – find files only
- `locate filename` – quick search using an index

## Useful options
- `-iname` – case-insensitive search
- `-size` – search by file size
- `-user` – search by file owner

File searching is essential
for system administration and troubleshooting.
