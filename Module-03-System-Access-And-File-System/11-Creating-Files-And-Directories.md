# Creating Files and Directories

Linux provides simple commands
to create files and directories.

## Creating files
- `touch filename` – create an empty file
- `echo "text" > file.txt` – create a file with content

## Creating directories
- `mkdir dirname` – create a directory
- `mkdir -p dir1/dir2` – create nested directories

These commands are commonly used
in daily Linux system administration.
