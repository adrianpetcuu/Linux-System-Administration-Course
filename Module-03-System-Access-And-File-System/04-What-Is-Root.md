# What Is Root

Root is the superuser account in Linux
with full administrative privileges.

## Root user characteristics
- Has unrestricted access to the system
- Can read, modify, or delete any file
- Can manage users, services, and hardware
- Uses the `#` prompt by default

Because root has full control, it should be used
carefully to avoid accidental system damage.
