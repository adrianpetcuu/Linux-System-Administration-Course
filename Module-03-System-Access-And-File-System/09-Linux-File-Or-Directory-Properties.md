# Linux File or Directory Properties

Every file and directory in Linux has
associated properties that control access and behavior.

## Common file properties
- Owner – the user who owns the file
- Group – the group associated with the file
- Permissions – read, write, and execute rights
- Size – file size in bytes
- Timestamp – creation, modification, and access time

## Viewing file properties
- Use `ls -l` to display detailed information
- Use `stat filename` for extended details

Understanding file properties
is essential for managing security and access control.
