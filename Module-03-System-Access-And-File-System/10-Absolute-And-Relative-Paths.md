# Absolute and Relative Paths

Paths in Linux define the location of files
and directories within the file system.

## Absolute paths
- Start from the root directory `/`
- Always show the full path
- Example: `/home/user/documents/file.txt`

## Relative paths
- Are based on the current directory
- Do not start with `/`
- Example: `documents/file.txt`

Understanding the difference between absolute
and relative paths is essential for navigation and scripting.
