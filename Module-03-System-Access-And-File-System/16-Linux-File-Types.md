# Linux File Types

Linux supports multiple file types,
each serving a specific purpose in the system.

## Common Linux file types
- `-` Regular file – text, binary, or data files
- `d` Directory – contains other files or directories
- `l` Symbolic link – reference to another file
- `c` Character device – hardware devices (keyboard, terminal)
- `b` Block device – storage devices (disks)
- `s` Socket – communication between processes
- `p` Named pipe (FIFO) – inter-process communication

File types can be identified
using the `ls -l` command.
