# Wildcards

Wildcards are special characters
used to match files and directories by pattern.

## Common wildcards
- `*` – matches zero or more characters
- `?` – matches exactly one character
- `[abc]` – matches any one character in the set
- `[a-z]` – matches a range of characters

## Examples
- `ls *.txt` – list all text files
- `rm file?.log` – remove files like file1.log
- `cp data[1-3].csv /backup`

Wildcards help perform operations
on multiple files efficiently.
