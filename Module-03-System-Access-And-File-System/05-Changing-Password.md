# Changing Password

Passwords in Linux can be changed using the `passwd` command.

## Change your own password
- Run the command: passwd
- Enter the current password
- Set and confirm the new password

## Change another user's password (root only)
- Run: passwd username

Regular password changes improve system security
and are a common administrative task.
