# Introduction to Linux File System

The Linux file system organizes data
in a hierarchical directory structure.

## Key concepts
- The root directory `/` is the top of the file system
- All files and directories are stored under `/`
- Devices and partitions are mounted into the directory tree

## Common directories
- `/home` – user home directories
- `/etc` – system configuration files
- `/var` – variable data and logs
- `/bin` and `/sbin` – essential system binaries

Understanding the file system structure
is fundamental for Linux administration.
